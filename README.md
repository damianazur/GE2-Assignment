Name: Damian Wojtowicz
Student Number: C17413722
Course Code: DT228/4

## Idea Generation:
### **Small Ship Models**
  - Fighters, Bombers
  
### **Large ships**
  - Ship carriers, Battle cruizers
  
### **Scenery**
  - Sun, Planets, Asteroids, Destroyed Ship Debris
  
### **Behaviours**
  - Persuit, Flee, Formations, Fire Missles, Defend a Ship, Attack Target, Evade Missles, Fall Back Under Damage, Flanking

### **Animations/Effects**
  - Lazer bullets, Lazer beams, Ship explosions, Bombs, Engine Effects/Particles

### **Audio**
  - Shooting, Ship Explosion, Commander giving order, Crew members respinding
  - Music
    - Peaceful music in beginning
    - Battle music
    - Post battle music/ending

### **Story Elements**
  - Calling for reinforcements (both enemy and allies)
  - Destroying an enemy target (possibly a big ship)
  - Escaping/Fighting into/in an asteroid field
  - Battle fleets fighting or A small crew defeating a tough enemy

## Story:
### Introduction
- An anomaly has been reported to the commander
- Commander sends a small squad of ships to investigate the anomaly
- Ally ships warp near the location of anomaly
- Anomaly is located near an asteroid field 
- Ships investigate the area
- An enemy fleet that is stationed there is discovered

### Middle
- Enemy sends fighter ships to attack allies
- Some ally scouts escape and others stay to fight the squad of enemy ships and buy the escapng allies some time
- (they need time to prepare warp)
- A battle scene takes place, the ally ships are outnumbered and lose
- The surviving scouts report to commander, who requests reinforcements from another planet
- Reinforcements warp to space station
- Enemy fleet grows and once all enemies have arrived they warp to the station
- The enemies start attacking the planes stationed there. The situation is looking hopeless.
- Ally reinforcements arrive shortly and the real battle begins

### End
- The allies eventually win and successfully defend the station
- Ally ships get into formation outside the station

## Components/Behaviours That Need to be Implemented:
- Fighter ship shoot (bullets with prediction)
- Cruizer ship shoot (beam)
- Warp
- Investigation (Search) behaviour
- Flee (When outnumbered)
- Formations/Squads (Moving as formation, Units are added to or removed from formation)
- Ship destruction
- Fire homing missle
- Evade missle (Barrel roll)
- Defend objective (attack enemies that approach the objective)
- Attack objective (destroy target)
- Arrive (Ships gather at objective)
